All rights reserved.\\n1. Introduction\\nScheduling may broadly be deﬁned as the allocation of resources to tasks over time in such a way that a predeﬁned per-\\nformance measure is optimized. From the viewpoint of production scheduling, the resources and tasks are commonly re-\\nferred to as machines and jobs and the commonly used performance measure is the completion times of jobs. This\\nproblem has been extensively researched since the early 1950’s. A comprehensive survey of literature on scheduling prob-\\nlems can be found in Graves [1], Lawler et al. [2], and Lee et al. [3].\\nThe classical job-shop scheduling problem (JSP) consists of a set of independent jobs, each having its own processing or-\\nder through a set of machines. Each job has an ordered set of operations, each of which must be processed on a predeﬁned\\nmachine. The problem, known to be strongly NP-hard, is to sequence operations on the machines so that the maximum com-\\npletion time over all jobs (C max) is minimized. Considerable research has been devoted to this problem in the literature. An\\noverview of history and main techniques used along with their reported results on the available benchmarking problems forJSP can be found in Jain and Meeran [4].\\nThe JSP assumes only one available machine for each operation and one feasible process plan (operation sequence) for\\neach job. It is common, however, in real-world scheduling problems to have a wider space for choices. Typically, in a man-\\nufacturing setting there are choices to be made in scheduling from among alternative machines on which to perform an\\noperation or from among alternative process plans of a job through a factory [5]. This paper considers two extensions to\\nthe JSP, i.e., routing ﬂexibility and process plan ﬂexibility . The former implies the availability of alternative machines for each\\noperation, and the latter the availability of alternative process plans for each job.\\n0307-904X/$ - see front matter /C2112009 Elsevier Inc.

       " Document(page_content='The ﬂexible job-shop scheduling problem (FJSP) is an extension of JSP in that it incorporates the routing ﬂexibility. Due to\\ncomplications resulting from the addition of routing ﬂexibility to the already difﬁcult JSP, researchers have focused on meta-\\nheuristic approaches to solve the FJSP. Among these are the evolutionary algorithms [6–8] , tabu search [9–13] , simulated\\nannealing [14,15] , ant colony [16] and hybrid approaches [17–22] .\\nThe FJSP with process plan ﬂexibility (FJSP-PPF) refers to a more complicated decision problem where jobs can have alter-\\nnative process plans. The literature for this problem is quite limited: evolutionary algorithms [23–25] , tabu search [26], sim-\\nulated annealing [27], and constraint-directed techniques [5].\\nAs for the mathematical models, the initial formulations of scheduling may be traced back to 1960’s. Shapiro [28] has pre-\\nsented mathematical programming models and solution methods that have been applied to several types of production\\nplanning and scheduling problems. Pan [29] has provided a review and comparison of mixed-integer linear programming\\n(MILP) formulations for job-shop, ﬂow-shop and permutation ﬂow-shop scheduling problems described in the literature.Kim and Egbelu [30] have developed a MILP model for JSP, where each job has predetermined alternative process plans. They\\nhave also presented two algorithms, each consisting of three modules, i.e., selecting a process plan combination, computing\\nthe lower bound on makespan, and scheduling. While the scheduling module of the ﬁrst algorithm depends on the devel-\\noped MILP model, that of the second algorithm employs earliest completion time (ECT) dispatching rule. Brandimarte\\n[31] has addressed a multi-objective scheduling problem with process plan ﬂexibility and proposed a hierarchical approach,\\nbased on a decomposition into machine loading and scheduling sub-problems. Brandimarte’s paper deals only with the ma-chine loading problem (selecting a process plan for each job and assigning operations to the machines). The problem is for-\\nmulated as a bicriterion integer programming model and two different heuristics are proposed, one based on surrogate\\nduality theory and the other based on a genetic descent algorithm.\\nLow and Wu [14] have addressed the FJSP with the objective of minimizing total tardiness, under setup time consider-\\nation. The problem presented as an extended disjunctive graph has been formulated as a mixed-integer programming model,\\nand then quadratic terms in the constraints have been linearized. A simulated annealing-based heuristic has been proposed\\nto solve the problem. The model presented in Low and Wu [14] has been extended to a multi-objective model by Low et al.\\n[19]. Thomalla [32] has proposed a discrete-time integer programming model for the FJSP with the objective of minimizing\\nthe sum of the weighted quadratic tardiness of the jobs and developed an algorithm based on Lagrangian relaxation. Choi\\nand Choi [33] have presented a MILP model for the FJSP with sequence-dependent setups, along with a local search algorithm\\nthat uses a dispatching rule to obtain an upper bound on the makespan of a subproblem. Gomes et al. [34] have addressed\\nthe FJSP with limited intermediate buffers and developed a multi-objective discrete time model that divides the scheduling\\nhorizon into a number of intervals of equal duration. This model has subsequently been generalized to account for re-circu-\\nlation, where jobs may visit certain machine groups more than once. Gao et al. [18] have formulated the FJSP with non-ﬁxed\\nmachine availability constraints, where each machine is subject to an arbitrary number of preventive maintenance tasks. Tosolve this problem, they have proposed a hybrid genetic algorithm. Fattahi et al. [20] have developed a mixed-integer pro-\\ngramming model and also six hybrid searching structures that differ in accordance with the searching approaches and heu-ristics they have used to solve FJSPs. Lee et al. [23] have presented a mathematical model for FJSP-PPF in which each\\ncustomer order has a due date and outsourcing is available. To solve the model, a genetic algorithm-based heuristic approachhas been developed.\\nIn this paper, a well-known model, which is developed by Manne [35] for JSPs, is modiﬁed with the purpose of enabling it\\nto solve the FJSPs. The resulting model is referred to as MILP-1. A mechanism is then incorporated into MILP-1 to take care of\\nthe FJSP-PPFs. The resulting model is referred to as MILP-2.\\nIn our search in the literature for the mathematical modelling approaches, all except one of the models we came\\nacross are different variations of the scheduling problems either with routing or with process plan ﬂexibility, but not\\nboth. The only exception is the model developed by Lee et al. [23]. However, this model is not comparable to MILP-2.\\nSince customer due dates and outsourcing are incorporated into the model, it does not address the FJSP-PPF as describedin Section 2.\\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows: in Section 2, a formal problem description is given. In Section 3, MILP-\\n1 is presented and compared with the model developed by Fattahi et al. [20]. Section 4isdevoted to the presentation of\\nMILP-2 and to\\nits computational results on test problems. Concluding remarks are made in Section 5.\\n2. Description of the problems\\nFJSP consists of a set of nindependent jobs J¼fjign\\ni¼1, each having its own processing order through a set of mmachines\\nM¼fmkgm\\nk¼1. A number of ‘iordered operations ðOi1;...;Oi‘ðiÞÞhas to be performed to complete job i. Operation jof job i(Oij),\\nrather than having to be processed on a predeﬁned machine mj2Mas in JSP, can be processed by any machine in a given set\\nMj#Mfor a given processing time tijk. The FJSP can be considered as consisting of many unique JSPs because of the routing\\nﬂexibility. For example, for a ﬁve-job three machine scheduling problem in which each job has four operations to be pro-\\ncessed and each operation can be processed by any two of the three machines, the FJSP can be viewed as a set of 220JSPs\\n[14]. While JSP consists of only a sequencing problem because the assignment of operations to the machines is given in ad-\\nvance, the FJSP turns into a routing as well as a sequencing problem: assigning each operation Oijto a machine selected from\\nthe set Mjand ordering operations on the machines so that Cmaxis minimized.1540 C.

       " Document(page_content='The following assumptions are made for FJSPs: the processing times are known and ﬁxed. The setup times are either\\nnegligible or included in the processing times. Transportation times are ignored. All jobs are available at time zero. No\\npre-emption is allowed, and a machine can process only one operation at a time. There is only one feasible process plan\\nfor each job.\\nThe FJSP-PPF considers multiple process plans for jobs by excluding the ﬁnal assumption of FJSP. The problem consists of a\\nset of njobs, each having a set of s(i)process plans Pi¼fqipðiÞgsðiÞ\\npðiÞ¼1. The process plan p(i)of job iis an ordered list of ‘ipðiÞoper-\\nations.

Comparison with Model F and evaluation\\nThe performance of the MILP-1 is compared with the solutions obtained by the mathematical model proposed by Fattahi\\net al. [20]. The mathematical model developed by Fattahi et al. [20] will henceforth be referred to as Model F. In Fattahi et al.\\n[20], randomly generated test problems are divided into two categories: small size FJSPs (SFJS1- SFJS10) and medium and\\nlarge size FJSPs (MFJS1- MFJS10). The test problems are deﬁned by the size of the problem ( i/C1j/C1k) in which the indices de-\\nnote the number of jobs, the number of operations for all jobs, and the number of machines, respectively. LINGO software\\nand branch and bound method are used to solve these problems. Since no method is able to generate optimal solutions for\\nthe medium and large size problems in polynomial time, they have presented two bounds (upper lower bounds) for the\\nMFJS1- MFJS10 problems.\\nMILP-1 has been coded in the mathematical modelling language AIMMS 3.8 and CPLEX 11.0 has been used to solve the\\ntest problems of Fattahi et al. [20]. The problems have been run on a PC that has Core 2 CPU and 1.86 GHz processor (1 GB\\nRAM). Running time is limited to 3600 s to compare MILP-1 with Model F on the same grounds. The solutions obtained arecompared in Table 1 and Figs. 1 and 2 . Since the mean differences between results and model parameters of Model F and\\nMILP-1 is not normally distributed a nonparametric test (Mann–Whitney) is applied to determine the signiﬁcance of differ-ences between populations. The Mann–Whitney Utest results are given in Table 2 .\\nThe results reached on the same test problems indicate that the overall performance of MILP-1 is superior to that of the\\nModel F. MILP-1 ﬁnds the optimal solution in all problems of SFJS at a lower CPU time. It also ﬁnds the optimal solutions of\\nthe ﬁrst ﬁve problems of MFJS (MFJS1-MFJS5) which Model F does not. The best integer solutions found in 3600 s for the\\nremaining problems (MFJS6-MFJS10) have lower C\\nmaxvalues than those in Model F.\\nAs shown in Fig. 1 , for small sized ﬂexible job shop problems the Cmaxvalues obtained by MILP-1 and Model F overlap.\\nHowever, a signiﬁcant difference occurs between the two models for medium sized problems. Under the same CPU time lim-\\nit (3600 s) for medium sized problems, MILP-1 signiﬁcantly dominates Model F in terms of the Cmaxresults.\\nThe second performance measure is the CPU times of the models. As shown in Fig. 2 MILP-1 outperforms the Model F for\\nboth small and medium sized problems.\\nIn order to analyze the statistical signiﬁcance of performance differences, Mann–Whitney Utest is applied to model\\nparameters and performance measures. Mann–Whitney tests for differences between two population medians. As shown\\ninTable 2 , probability values prove that there is a statistically signiﬁcant difference between Model F and MILP-1 in terms\\nof CPU time, number of integer variables and constraints. Probability (P ) values show whether there is a signiﬁcant difference\\nbetween Model F and MILP-1 in terms of model parameters and CPU time performance measure by using predeﬁned alevel\\n(a= 0.05). If Pvalue is lower than the a, this means that there is a statistically signiﬁcant difference between two population\\nmedians.\\nThe number of integer variables as well as the number of constrains in MILP-1 are far smaller than those in Model F. In\\nboth of the models the bulk of the binary variables and the constraints are used for avoiding the machines from doing more\\nthan one operation at the same instant.1542 C.

The number of Xijhkvariables adds up to mnh jki=m(nhj)2under the assumptions that hjis the same\\nfor each job and that each operation of each job can be assigned to each position on each one of the machines.\\nWe have instead used, in line with the approach ﬁrst adopted by Manne [35], the binary variables Yiji0j0kwhere operation\\nOijis not necessarily the immediate predecessor of operation Oi0j0. The number of Yiji0j0kvariables adds up to mðn/C01Þh2\\njunder\\nthe same assumptions excluding the one about the positions on the machines.\\nIn terms of the 2 /C12/C12 problem (the ﬁrst one in Table 1 ) the number of Xijhkvariables is 32, while the number of Yiji0j0k\\nvariables is only 8. The only other binary variables Yijhin Model F and Xijkin MILP-1 used for assigning the operations of\\nthe jobs to the machines are the same in number, being equal to 8 in the case of Problem 2 /C12/C12.\\nAs indicated in Table 1 , the difference between the models in terms of the total number of binary variables and of the total\\nnumber of the constraints grows as the size of the problems gets larger. This results from the fact that Model F rests on the\\nnotion of the positions on the machines, whereas our model does not.\\nThe outcomes of MILP-1 are also compared to those of the six different heuristic algorithms proposed by Fattahi et al.\\n[20]. On each one of the same test problems, Fattahi et al. [20] have run the algorithms 10 times. The best Cmaxvalues they\\nhave found are presented in Table 3 . No information is available as to whether the CPU times are the average or the lowest\\ntimes.\\nIn terms of the 10 problems in the SFJS category, the CPU times of MILP-1 are all below 1 s and lower than those of the six\\nheuristic algorithms developed by Fattahi et al. [20]. In ﬁve of the problems, Cmaxvalues found by HTS/SA, ISA, and ITS are\\nhigher than the optimum values found by MILP-1.\\nAs for the 10 problems in the MFJS category, in the ﬁrst three problems the CPU times of MILP-1 are all lower than those of\\nthe heuristic algorithms. Except for MFJS9, Cmaxvalues found by all of the heuristic algorithms are higher than the ones found\\nby MILP-1.Table 2\\nMann–Whitney Utest results for Model F and MILP-1.\\nCmax CPU time # Integer variables # Non-integer variables # Constraints\\nP 0.4154 0.0003 0.0001 0.1012 0.0000\\nTable 3The computational results of MILP-1 and the heuristic algorithms.\\nProblem No. Size ( i/C1j/C1k) MILP-1 HSA/SAaHSA/TSbHTS/TScHTS/SAdISAeITSf\\nCPU Cmax CPU Cmax CPU Cmax CPU Cmax CPU Cmax CPU Cmax CPU Cmax\\nSFJS1 2/C12/C12 0.02 66g12 66g16 6g16 6g26 6g25 66g16 6g\\nSFJS2 2/C12/C12 0.00 107g13 107g1 107g1 107g3 107g35 107g1 107g\\nSFJS3 3/C12/C12 0.02 221g14 221g1 221g1 221g5 221g40 221g1 221g\\nSFJS4 3/C12/C12 0.00 355g14 355g1 355g1 355g7 355g45 355g1 390\\nSFJS5 3 /C12/C12 0.06 119g14 119g2 119g1 119g9 119g50 119g1 137\\nSFJS6 3 /C13/C12 0.03 320g18 320g3 320g1 320g7 320g50 320g2 320g\\nSFJS7 3/C13/C15 0.02 397g16 397g4 397g1 397g9 397g55 397g2 397g\\nSFJS8 3/C13/C14 0.02 253g17 253g5 253g2 253g10 256 35 253g2 253g\\nSFJS9 3/C13/C13 0.03 210g19 210g6 210g2 210g11 210g55 215 3 215\\nSFJS10 4 /C13/C15 0.02 516g21 516g7 516g4 516g10 516g55 516g3 617\\nMFJS1 5 /C13/C16 0.44 468g22 479 55 491 15 469 30 469 60 488 9 548\\nMFJS2 5 /C13/C17 6.49 446g62 495 55 482 12 482 30 468 60 478 8 457\\nMFJS3 6 /C13/C17 4.14 466g82 553 70 538 20 533 50 538 107 599 8 606\\nMFJS4 7 /C13/C17 1779.03 564g102 656 85 650 27 634 80 618 195 703 9 870\\nMFJS5 7 /C13/C17 50.98 514g105 650 110 662 40 625 64 625 240 674 10 729\\nMFJS6 8 /C13/C17 3600 635 125 762 130 785 96 717 102 730 330 856 50 816\\nMFJS7 8 /C14/C17 3600 935 197 1020 290 1081 129 964 190 947 480 1066 240 1048\\nMFJS8 9 /C14/C18 3600 905 230 1030 325 1122 405 970 182 922 610 1328 370 1220\\nMFJS9 11 /C14/C18 3600 1192 330 1180 660 1243 660 1105 330 1105 840 1148 680 1124\\nMFJS10 12 /C14/C18 3600 1276 425 1538 600 1615 960 1404 430 1384 850 1546 763 1737\\naHierarchical approach and simulated annealing (SA) heuristic for assignment problem and SA heuristic for sequencing problem.\\nbHierarchical approach and SA heuristic for assignment problem and tabu search (TS) heuristic for sequencing problem.\\ncHierarchical approach and TS heuristic for assignment problem and TS heuristic for sequencing problem.\\ndHierarchical approach and TS heuristic for assignment problem and SA heuristic for sequencing problem.\\neIntegrated approach with SA heuristic.\\nfIntegrated approach with TS heuristic.\\ngOptimal Cmaxvalue.1544 C.

Table 4 shows the process plan and routing ﬂexibility levels with respect to each problem size.\\nTable 5 presents the systematical approach used for determining the operations, machine alternatives for operations and\\nprocessing times of operations for each job.\\nThe details of the ﬁrst test problem P1–11 (5 /C25, low process plan ﬂexibility-low routing ﬂexibility) are given in Table 6 .\\nIn this test problem with ﬁve jobs, two process plans, six operations, and ﬁve machines, there are two alternative process\\nplans with a given ordered set of operations for each job and two alternative machines for each operation. The number of\\nthe operations in the process plans range from 2 to 4.\\nThe solution obtained by MILP-2 for P1–11 and the corresponding Gantt chart is presented in Table 7 and Fig. 3 .

       " Document(page_content='5. Conclusion\\nThis study started with the FJSP, the generalized form of the JSP. In the ﬁrst step, a mixed-integer linear programming\\nmodel (MILP-1) is developed for the FJSPs. MILP-1 is then compared to the only alternative model we found in the literature\\nand its superiority over Model F in terms of model size, CPU time and Cmaxvalue is displayed. In the second step, process plan\\nﬂexibility is incorporated into FJSP, and MILP-1 is modiﬁed accordingly to give rise to MILP-2, for which there appears to beno comparable mathematical model in the literature. Hypothetical test problems that involve routing and process plan ﬂex-\\nibility are used for testing MILP-2. The computational results on a variety of test problems with different sizes and ﬂexibilitylevels are presented and evaluated.\\nMakespan is adopted as the single performance measure in MILP-1 due to the fact that it is the single measure used in the\\nmodel that MILP-1 is compared with in this paper, namely Model F. Since it is an extension of MILP-1, we chose to retain the\\nmakespan as the single measure in MILP-2. It must however be mentioned that additional measures such as total tardiness,\\nthe number of tardy jobs and the load balance of the machines can readily be incorporated into MILP-2.\\nThe authors of this paper are planning as a future study to develop a general framework model that embodies sequence-\\ndependent setup times and process plan costs along with routing and process plan ﬂexibilities.\\nReferences\\n[1] S.C.

This paper deals with twoNP-hard optimization problems: ﬂexible job-shop scheduling problems (FJSPs) that\\nencompass routing and sequencing sub-problems, and the FJSPs with process plan ﬂexibil-\\nity (FJSP-PPFs) that additionally include the process plan selection sub-problem. The studyis carried out in two steps. In the ﬁrst step, a mixed-integer linear programming model(MILP-1) is developed for FJSPs and compared to an alternative model in the literature\\n(Model F) in terms of computational efﬁciency. In the second step, one other mixed-integer\\nlinear programming model, a modiﬁcation of MILP-1, for the FJSP-PPFs is presented alongwith its computational results on hypothetically generated test problems.\\n/C2112009 Elsevier Inc.

From the viewpoint of production scheduling, the resources and tasks are commonly re-\\nferred to as machines and jobs and the commonly used performance measure is the completion times of jobs. This\\nproblem has been extensively researched since the early 1950’s. A comprehensive survey of literature on scheduling prob-\\nlems can be found in Graves [1], Lawler et al. [2], and Lee et al. [3].\\nThe classical job-shop scheduling problem (JSP) consists of a set of independent jobs, each having its own processing or-\\nder through a set of machines. Each job has an ordered set of operations, each of which must be processed on a predeﬁned\\nmachine. The problem, known to be strongly NP-hard, is to sequence operations on the machines so that the maximum com-\\npletion time over all jobs (C max) is minimized. Considerable research has been devoted to this problem in the literature. An\\noverview of history and main techniques used along with their reported results on the available benchmarking problems forJSP can be found in Jain and Meeran [4].\\nThe JSP assumes only one available machine for each operation and one feasible process plan (operation sequence) for\\neach job. It is common, however, in real-world scheduling problems to have a wider space for choices. Typically, in a man-\\nufacturing setting there are choices to be made in scheduling from among alternative machines on which to perform an\\noperation or from among alternative process plans of a job through a factory [5]. This paper considers two extensions to\\nthe JSP, i.e., routing ﬂexibility and process plan ﬂexibility . The former implies the availability of alternative machines for each\\noperation, and the latter the availability of alternative process plans for each job.\\n0307-904X/$ - see front matter /C2112009 Elsevier Inc.
